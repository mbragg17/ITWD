      <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
      <p>
        Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) combine the best features of both web and mobile applications to provide users with a fast, reliable, and engaging experience. The concept emerged as web technologies advanced, enabling websites to offer offline capabilities, push notifications, and a more native-like user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        PWAs are built using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, yet they incorporate advanced features like service workers and web app manifests. These elements allow PWAs to work efficiently even in low or no network connectivity, thus significantly enhancing user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shift towards PWAs reflects a broader trend in web development: the demand for more responsive, reliable, and accessible digital experiences. This paradigm not only improves performance but also reduces development costs by eliminating the need for separate native app versions across different platforms.

      <!-- Detailed Theoretical Background -->
      <section id="theory">
        <h2>Theoretical Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) represent a fusion of modern web standards and mobile app experiences. The development of PWAs was driven by the need to deliver high-performance, reliable, and engaging applications without the overhead of native app development. At their core, PWAs leverage service workers, web app manifests, and responsive design principles to offer enhanced user experiences, even under unreliable network conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory behind PWAs rests on several key concepts: enhanced caching strategies for offline access, the ability to send push notifications, and the seamless integration of web applications with device hardware. This approach not only reduces development and maintenance costs but also expands the potential user base by breaking the barriers imposed by traditional app stores.

      <!-- Benefits List -->
      <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improved performance and speed:</strong> PWAs utilize caching and other optimization techniques, ensuring that pages load quickly even on slow networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Offline capabilities:</strong> Thanks to service workers, PWAs can function without an active internet connection, providing a seamless experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> PWAs run on any device with a standards-compliant browser, eliminating the need for multiple versions.</li>
          <li><strong>No need for app store distribution:</strong> Users can install PWAs directly from the browser, bypassing the traditional app store channels.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Challenges List -->
      <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent browser support:</strong> While modern browsers are increasingly compatible, some legacy systems do not fully support PWA features.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited hardware access compared to native apps:</strong> Although improving, PWAs still have restrictions when accessing certain device functionalities that native apps can leverage.</li>
          <li><strong>User perceptions of quality versus native applications:</strong> Many users still associate high-quality experiences with native apps, which can impact the adoption of PWAs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These challenges highlight the trade-offs involved in adopting PWAs. While the benefits offer significant improvements in user engagement and cost efficiency, developers must remain mindful of browser compatibility and evolving user expectations.
